once we find open ports, we can try to find public exploits (if any).

tools can be used = serachsploit


to install the db of existing exploits are 
sudo apt install exploitdb -y
-y - yes to all question

usage:
searchsploit openssh 7.2

metasploit

msfconsole

search exploit eternalblue

then, use the path
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

show options - to view the module options

exploit/run - to run the exploit
